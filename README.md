# VelocityAndSpin
This project looks at the connection between a 4-seam fastball's velocity and spin rate to how often a batter swings and misses.

The RMD file is the original R code and the PDF file is the knitted document. Unfortunately, it won't be possible to download and knit/run code in the .rmd, as I am unable to upload the datasets because of file size limitations.
